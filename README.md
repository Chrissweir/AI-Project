Overview:
============
This project is a simple introduction into AI development in Java. We utilise many different techniques acquired throught the year to create a game in which the enemy is controlled with sophisticated AI systems such as: Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Maze Traversal Algorithms.

Running Instructions:
===========
1. Download the JAR from this repo.
2. Run the JAR with the following code:
"""
java â€“cp ./game.jar ie.gmit.sw.ai.GameRunner
"""

Game Instructions:
==============
* The player (yellow node) has to reach the exit (grey node) door to win.
* The player should avoid fighting with spiders (red nodes) unless well armed (sword, bomb, Hbomb). 
* The colour codings are for map overview (KeyPress z).
